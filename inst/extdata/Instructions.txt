These files provide example inputs to the code.  They can be specified using the options:

pat_file: Example_genetic_temporal_data.csv
mov_file: Example_movement_file.csv
ali_file: Example_sequences.fa
ward_file: Example_ward_file.csv

The example sequences file has been constructed so that all of the variants in the sequence appear in the first 10 positions in the genome.  Looking at it with an alignment viewer will give a simple idea of how the sequences relate to one another.

We suggest running the code with different values for the data_type option.  Our interpretation of the results is as follows:

Data type 0: This just uses the times at which individuals became symptomatic.  Individual 1008 does not seem to infect anyone else, but otherwise most of the cases appear to be connected to each other.   Sequences with lower numbers are generally more likely to infect individuals with higher numbers.

Data type 1: With the addition of sequence information, individuals 1009 and 1010 appear more separate.  They may have been infected by 1001 or 1002 but most of the links to them at type 0 have disappeared.   There seems to be a cluster of individuals 1001 to 1008.

Data type 2: This step has added in patient location data, describing all of the individuals except 1004 to 1006.  The links from 1001 and 1002 to 1009 and 1010 are now gone with these last two individuals being seen as clearly separate from the remaining cases.  The plot suggests that 1007 infected 1008 in the absence of other known cases.

Data type 3: This step has added in location data for individuals 1004 to 1006.  More resolution is now seen around these indiviudals, with for example 1006 not having infected anyone else, but possibly having been infected by 1002 or 1003.  We note that generally the question of who infected who is not resolved for the cluster of cases at the top right of the plot, but a cluster linking the individuals 1001 to 1008, and a second linking 1009 and 1010, could be identified from this plot for further investigation.

We may add a note here about the location data used in our code.  Two formats are used, but in theory all of the information could be provided within a single location file.  No calcalculation is ultimately performed which depends upon which file location information came from.  The rationale behind the data formats arises from patient and HCW data coming from different sources in the original data studied.
