Description: A tool which combines genome sequence and the locations of infected individuals, using a statistical and evolutionary model, to estimate the likelihood that transmission occurred between particular individuals, and then to identify clusters of infections.  It is currently designed to apply to COVID-19 infection dynamics on hospital wards.
